# Espressif Component Manager

This directory does not need to be included in any wolfSSL distributions. The files
contained herein are used only to publish wolfSSL as a managed component to the [ESP Registry](https://components.espressif.com/).

See the local [wolfssl_component_publish.sh script](./wolfssl_component_publish.sh) for the steps used to copy wolfSSL
source files locally.

The wolfSSL [README.md](https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/blob/master/README.md) is stripped of an embedded HTML
anchor tags that do not render well.

The local [README_REGISTRY_PREPEND.md](./README_REGISTRY_PREPEND.md) text is prepended to the 
wolfSSL [README.md](https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/blob/master/README.md) before being published to the registry.
